## Key Features

### P2P Networking for Game Connectivity

- **Decentralized Multiplayer:** Enables direct peer-to-peer connections between players, allowing each game instance to function as a node within a decentralized network.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Eliminates reliance on centralized servers, reducing costs and single points of failure.
- **Scalable Networking:** Designed to support a large number of concurrent players with efficient resource utilization.

### Anonymity Network Integration

- **Enhanced Privacy:** Plans to integrate with anonymity networks such as Tor or I2P to conceal players' IP addresses and metadata.
- **Secure Communication:** Utilizes encrypted channels to protect data exchange between nodes.
- **User Safety:** Protects players from potential DDoS attacks and location tracking.

### Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)

- **Secure Verification:** Implements experimental ZKP mechanisms, allowing players to prove ownership of in-game assets without revealing sensitive information.
- **Anti-Cheating Measures:** Verifies player actions and transactions without exposing underlying data, reducing fraud and cheating.
- **Cryptographic Innovations:** Explores cutting-edge cryptographic techniques to enhance game security and integrity.

  *Note:* ZKPs are advanced cryptographic protocols that enable one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that a statement is true without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself.

### Distributed Ledger Technology

- **Blockchain Integration:** Synchronizes game state across all nodes using blockchain technology.
- **Consensus Mechanisms:** Implements consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Stake, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) to ensure fairness and consistency.
- **Immutable Records:** Maintains a tamper-proof ledger of game events, transactions, and player interactions.

### Comprehensive Web3 Integration

- **Asset Management:** Supports the creation and integration of NFTs and other blockchain-based assets within games.
- **Smart Contract Interaction:** Provides interfaces for seamless interaction with smart contracts on various blockchain networks.
- **Developer Tools and SDKs:** Offers a suite of tools and libraries in C++ to streamline the development process and reduce complexity.

### Wallet Integration via Browser

- **Seamless Wallet Connections:** Enables players to connect their crypto wallets through their web browsers, similar to popular Web3 applications and games.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Simplifies the process of linking wallets without requiring in-game software modifications.
- **Security and Privacy:** Ensures secure handling of wallet data and transactions through encrypted communication channels.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Supports major wallet providers and browsers, ensuring broad accessibility for players.

---

## Architecture Overview

Rox-Engine's architecture is modular and extensible, consisting of the following core components:

- **Networking Module:** Handles P2P connections, data transmission, and network topology management.
- **Blockchain Module:** Manages blockchain interactions, including transactions, smart contracts, and asset management.
- **Security Module:** Implements cryptographic functions, ZKPs, and anonymity features.
- **Game Engine Core:** Provides essential game development functionalities like rendering, physics, input handling, and scene management.
- **Wallet Integration Module:** Facilitates secure connections between the game engine and players crypto wallets via web browsers.
- **SDK and APIs:** Offers a set of tools and interfaces for developers to build and customize their games efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:**
  - Windows 10 or higher

- **Compiler:**
  - A modern C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC 2015+)

- **Build System:**
  - CMake 3.21 or higher

- **Dependencies:**
  - **OpenGL:** For rendering graphics. [Installation Guide](https://www.opengl.org/wiki/Getting_Started)
  - **Boost Libraries:** [Installation Guide](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/more/getting_started/index.html)
  - **OpenSSL:** For cryptographic functions. [Installation Guide](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
  - **[Torox-Math Library](https://github.com/Torox-Lab/torox-math):** For advanced mathematical functions.
  - **[Orox-Token Library](https://github.com/Torox-Lab/orox-token):** For token and blockchain interactions.

*Note:* Torox-Math, Torox-Token are under consideration for future integration and are not required at this stage.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Torox-Lab/rox-engine.git
   cd rox-engine
   ```

2. **Initialize Submodules**

   If using Git submodules for dependencies:

   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure all external libraries are installed and properly linked. Refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section for installation guides.

4. **Build the Engine**

   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   ```

### Basic Usage

After building the engine, you can start creating your game project:

1. **Create a New Project**

   Use the provided project generator script << Not available yet. you will need to go to [Peer to Peer Games](https://github.com/Torox-Labs/p2p-game-sample) >>:

   ```bash
   ./tools/create_project.sh MyGameProject
   ```

2. **Include Rox-Engine Headers**

   In your C++ source files:

   ```cpp
   #include <RoxApp/RoxApp.h>
   ```

   *Note:* Currently, to use the engine, you need to include `RoxApp/RoxApp.h`. We plan to update this to `Rox/Rox.h` in future releases for consistency.

3. **Initialize the Engine**

  ```cpp 
  class MyGame : public RoxApp::RoxApp
  {
   // Your game logic here
  
  private:
    bool onSplash() override
    {
      ...
    }
    bool onInit() override
    {
      ...
    }
    void onFrame(unsigned int dt) override
    {
      ...
    }

    ...
  };
   
  int main() {
       MyGame my_game;
       RoxLogger::log() << "My Game\n";
       app.startWindow(100, 100, 640, 480, 0);
       return 0;
   };
   ```

4. **Build and Run Your Game**

   Use your preferred build system to compile and run your game project.
